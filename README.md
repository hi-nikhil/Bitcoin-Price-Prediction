# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
Tested and evaluated different Deep Learning Models
1.Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) 
2.Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) 
for Bitcoin Price Prediction. 
Compared the results of both model to see which is giving better prediction.

When we compare the both results (RNN and LSTM).

we can see that we have better prediction with LSTM.
